Biometric Evaluation Framework
==============================
Biometric Evaluation Framework is a set of C++ classes, error codes, and design
patterns used to create a common environment to provide logging, data
management, error handling, and other functionality that is needed for many
applications used in the testing of biometric software.

The goals of Biometric Evaluation Framework include:

 * reduce the amount of I/O error handling implemented by applications;
 * provide standard interfaces for data management and logging;
 * remove the need for applications to handle low-level events from the
   operating system;
 * provide time tracking and constraints for blocks of code;
 * reduce potential for memory errors and corruption;
 * simplify the use of parallel processing.

How to Build
------------
If all requirements have been met, building is as simple as:
```bash
make -C common/
```

### Build Configuration
The makefile understands several variables:

 * **`CC`**: C compiler;
 * **`CXX`**: C++ compiler;
 * **`MPICXX`**: OpenMPI compiler;
 * **`EXTRA_CXXFLAGS`**: Additional compile-time flags to **`$(CC)`**;
 * **`EXTRA_CXXFLAGS`**: Additional compile-time flags to **`$(CXX)`**;
 * **`EXTRA_LDFLAGS`**: Additional link-time flags to **`$(CXX)`**;
 * **`32`**: Force 32-bit compilation when set to `1`;
 * **`64`**: Force 64-bit compilation when set to `1`.

Requirements
------------
 * A C++ 2011 compiler:
	* `g++` >= 4.7
	* `clang++` >= 3.1
	* `icpc` >= 15.0

 * A supported operating system:
	* RHEL/CentOS 7.x
	* macOS >= 10.9
	* Cygwin 1.7.x

 * System packages (depending on desired modules, see below).

Other operating systems and compilers are likely to work as expected, but have
not been thoroughly tested.

Installing
----------
A pre-compiled version of Biometric Evaluation framework for RHEL/CentOS 7 is
available from the
[releases](https://github.com/usnistgov/BiometricEvaluation/releases)
page on GitHub. These packages have been signed with our
[public key]
(https://github.com/usnistgov/BiometricEvaluation/blob/master/beframework_signing_key.asc).

```bash
# Import the public key
rpm --import beframework_signing_key.asc

# Verify the signature
rpm --checksig libbiomeval-9.0-1.x86_64.rpm
libbiomeval-9.0-1.x86_64.rpm: rsa sha1 (md5) pgp md5 OK

# Install
rpm --install libbiomeval-9.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

A version compiled from source can be installed via the top-level makefile.
```bash
make install
```

System Packages
---------------
Some modules require system packages that may not be installed by default on
all operating systems. Package names are listed below for RHEL/CentOS and macOS
(via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)). Other operating systems may use
similarly-named packages.

#### NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS)
[NBIS](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nist-biometric-image-software-nbis) is supported under current versions
of RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu, and macOS. The Framework repository contains a subset
of NBIS that is built from the top-level makefile. However, if there is a need
to use the _official_ NBIS, then the makefile in `common/src/libbiomeval` can
be changed to use that NBIS build. Biometric Evaluation Framework will look for NBIS
to be installed at `/usr/local/nbis`. To build NBIS,
[download the source](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/products-and-services/image-group-open-source-server-nigos),
and follow this basic build procedure:

```
./setup.sh /usr/local/nbis [--without-X11]
make config it
sudo make install
```
