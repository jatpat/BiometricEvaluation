\chapter{Overview}

The \lname (\sname)
is a set of C++\cite{cpp:plguide} classes, error codes, and design
patterns used to create a common environment to provide logging, data
management, error handling, and other functionality that is needed for many
applications used in the testing of biometric software. The goals of the
framework include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce the amount of I/O error handling implemented by applications;
\item Provide standard interfaces for data management and logging;
\item Remove the need for applications to handle low-level events from the
operating system (signals, etc.);
\item Provide services for timing the execution of code blocks;
\item Allow appications to constrain the amount of processing time used
by a block of code.
\end{itemize}

\sname is divided into several packages, each providing a set of
related functionality, such as error handling and timing operations. The
packages are an informal concept, mapped to formal C++ name spaces, e.g.
{\em IO} and {\em Time}.
All classes within \sname belong to the top-level {\em BiometricEvaluation}
name space.
