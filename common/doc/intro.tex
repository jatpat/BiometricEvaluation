\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the framework and application programming interfaces
(API) used to support the evaluation of biometric software within the Image
Group at NIST. An evaluation consists of the testing of vendor-supplied
software that implements certain biometric algorithms, such as fingerprint
matching or face recognition. The NIST Image Group defines a test process
and API for each evaluation that vendors implement in there software, which
is delivered to NIST as a software library. A common test driver is used to
call the vendor library to perform the biometric operation.
In order to support the common functionality used across all evaluations, such
as logging, file input/output, etc., a common framework is used.
