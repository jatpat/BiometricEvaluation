\chapter{Feature}
\label{chp-feature}
The \namespace{Feature} package contains those items that relate to the representation of
biometric features, such as fingerprint minutiae, facial features (eyes, etc.),
and related information. Objects of these class types are typically associated
with \namespace{View}~(\chpref{chp-view}) or
\namespace{DataInterchange}~(\chpref{chp-datainterchange})
objects. For example, a minutiae object is usually obtained from a finger view,
which may have been obtained from a data interchange object representing an
entire biometric record for an individual.

The data contained within a \class{Feature} object is represented as the
``native'' format as it was extracted from the underlying data record. There
is no translation to a common format and it is the application's responsibility 
to interpret or translate the data as necessary.

Currently, fingerprint and palm print minutiae are the features supported within
the \sname. As development continues, additional features contained within
biometric data records will be supported.

\section{ANSI/NIST Features}
\label{sec-ansinistfeatures}
The ANSI/NIST~\cite{std:an2k} standard defines several features represented
as data elements within a record. Fingerprint and palm minutiae is contained
within Type-9 record. The \class{AN2K7Minutiae} class, contained in the Feature
package, represents a single Type-9 record. An object of this class can be
constructed directly from a complete ANSI/NIST record. However, it is more
common for an application to retrieve these objects from the \class{AN2KView}
object defined in the \namespace{Finger} package~(\chpref{chp-finger}).

See \lstref{lst:an2kfingerviewuse} for a complete example of how to obtain
the fingerprint minutiae data from an ANSI/NIST record.

\section{ISO/INCITS Features}

The ISO~\cite{std:iso19794-2} and INCITS~\cite{std:ansi378-2004} fingerprint
minutiae standards are represented within \sname with the same class,
\class{INCITSMinutiae}, as the minutiae format is identical in both standards.

\lstref{lst:incitsfingerviewuse} shows how to create a view object for the
fingerprint minutiae record contained in a file.
