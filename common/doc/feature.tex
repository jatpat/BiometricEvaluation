\chapter{Feature}
\label{chp-feature}
The Feature package contains those items that relate to the representation of
biometric features, such as fingerprint minutiae, facial features (eyes, etc.),
and related information. Objects of these class types are typically associated
with View~(\chpref{chp-view}) or
DataInterchange~(\chpref{chp-datainterchange})
objects. For example, a minutiae object is usually obtained from a finger view,
which may have been obtained from a data interchange object representing an
entire biometric record for an individual.

The data contained within a Feature object is represented as the ``native''
format as it was extracted from the underlying data record. There is no
translation to a common format and it is the application's responsibility to
interpret or translate the data as necessary.

\section{ANSI/NIST Features}
\label{sec-ansinistfeatures}
The ANSI/NIST~\cite{std:an2k} standard defines several features represented
as data elements within a record. Fingerprint and palm minutiae is contained
within Type-9 record. The AN2K7Minutiae class, contained in the Feature
package, represents a single Type-9 record. An object of this class can be
constructed directly from a complete ANSI/NIST record. However, it is more
common for an application to retrieve these objects from the AN2KView object
defined in the Finger package~(\chpref{chp-finger}).
