\chapter{Time and Timing}
\label{chp-time}

The Time package within the \lname\ provides a set of classes for performing
timing-related operations, such as elapsed time and limiting execution time.

\section{Elapsed Time}

The {\em Timer} class provides applications a method to determine how long
a block of code takes to execute. On many systems (e.g. Linux) the timer
resolution is in microseconds.

\lstref{timeruse} shows how an application can use a {\em Timer}
object to limit obtain the amount of time used for the execution of a block
of code.

\lstset{language=c++}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using the Timer}, label=timeruse]
#include <be_time_timer.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	Time::Timer timer = new Time::Timer();

	try {
		atimer->start();
		// do something useful, or not
		atimer->stop();
		cout << "Elapsed time: " << atimer->elapsed() << endl;
	} catch (Error::StrategyError &e) {
		cout << "Failed to create timer." << endl;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Limiting Execution Time}

The {\em Watchdog} class allows applications to control the amount of time
that a block of code has to execute. The time can be {\em real} (i.e. ``wall'')
time, or {\em process} time (not available on Windows). One typical usage for
a watchdog timer is when a call is made to a function that may never return,
due to problems processing an input biometric image.

Watch dog timers can be used in conjunction with {\em SignalManager} in
order to both limit the processing time of a call, and handle all signals
generated as a result of that call. See~\ref{sec-signalhandling} for
information on the {\em SignalManager} class.

One restriction on the use of {\em Watchdog} is that the POSIX calls for
signal management ({\em signal(3)}, {\em sigaction(2)}, etc.) cannot be
invoked inside of the watchdog block. This restriction includes calls to
{\em sleep(3)} because it is based on signal handling as well.

\lstref{watchdoguse} shows how an application can use a {\em Watchdog}
object to limit the about of process time for a block of code.

\lstset{language=c++}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using the Watchdog}, label=watchdoguse]
#include <be_time_watchdog.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])

    Time::Watchdog theDog = new Time::Watchdog(Time::Watchdog::PROCESSTIME);
    theDog->setInterval(300);	// 300 microseconds

    Time::Timer timer;

    BEGIN_WATCHDOG_BLOCK(theDog, watchdogblock1);
        timer.start();
        // Do something that may take more than 300 usecs
        timer.stop();
        cout << "Total time was " <<  timer.elapsed() << endl;
    END_WATCHDOG_BLOCK(theDog, watchdogblock1);
    if (theDog->expired()) {
        timer.stop();
        cerr << "That took too long." << endl;
    }
{
}
\end{lstlisting}

Within the {\em Watchdog} header file, two macros are defined:
{\tt BEGIN\_WATCHDOG\_BLOCK()} and {\tt END\_WATCHDOG\_BLOCK()}, each taking
the {\em Watchdog} object and label as parameters. The label must be unique
for each watch dog block.  The use of these macros greatly simplifies
watchdog timers for the application, and it is recommended that applications
use these macros instead of directly invoking the methods of the
{\em Watchdog} class, except for setting the timeout value.

Any processing that is normally done at the end of the Watchdog block must also
be done within the expired() check
due to the fact that process control jumps to the end of the Watchdog block
in the event of a timeout.
A typical example is the use of the Timer
object inside a Watchdog block, as the example in \lstref{watchdoguse}
shows. In most cases, however, careful application design can remove the need
for duplicate code. In the example, placing the Timer start()/stop() calls
outside of the Watchdog block simplifies the coding, although the small amount
of time for the Watchdog setup and tear down would be included in the time.
