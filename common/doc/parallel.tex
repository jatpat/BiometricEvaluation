\section{MPI Parallel Processing Package}
The \namespace{MPI} package is a set of APIs used implement parallel processing
using the MPI~\cite{mpi} network-based messaging system. The core concept
implemented in the framework is that of a distributor, one or more receivers,
and a work package processing element to be implemented by the application.
